Explain Explainer for MySQL Queries. Something like an upgraded `EXPLAIN` command for browser. Highlights and explains MySQL queries. It gives also hints and links. Hope it will help. More info here : http://mxx.mnstrl.org/

Getting started
---------------
 - [Download last release archive](https://github.com/rap2hpoutre/mysql-xplain-xplain/releases/download/v0.2.0/rap2h-mysql-explain-explain-0.2.0.zip) and unzip it into your webroot folder or install via composer : `composer create-project rap2h/mysql-explain-explain --prefer-dist`
 - Launch your web server, goto http://localhost/xplain or something like that
 - Start typing your queries

Why?
----
MySQL EXPLAIN command is sometimes hard to understand. We try to make it more readable with some improvements. In a web browser.
